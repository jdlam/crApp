# [crApp (Clean Restroom App)](https://secure-ocean-9918.herokuapp.com/)

Do you need a restroom? I mean, NEED a restroom??
If you do, then this is the right app for you
crApp is a directory of public restrooms
Is it guarded by employees who require you to purchase before using their restroom?
Users can give directions on how to avoid those pesky employees

## How Do I Use crApp?

It's simple! Just follow the instructions below:

Are you in dire need of a restroom? Simply click the "Bathrooms Near Me" button, and it will show you all of the bathrooms within a set radius of your current position. Please be sure to allow geolocation services, otherwise, crApp will not be able to track your location.

Did you just use an awesome public restroom? Sign up, Log in, and then you'll be able to write a review for the bathroom you just used.

Stumbled across the best hidden bathroom in the area? Once you're logged in, you can create a new bathroom if it isn't already listed by another user.
